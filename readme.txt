Communicate Data Findings


Data Set
 The dataset contains about 13M rows and 18 columns.The attributes include bike_id,gender,date of birth,start and end station id,latitude,longitude,station name etc.We remove unnecessary columns and change the data type of few attributes as a part of cleaning.Then we plot univariate,bivariate and multivariate plots.


The possible questions that can be framed
 
1.What are the most visited start and end stations?

2.How does the trend of rides change per hour,weekday and month?

3.Does the usage of bike share system depend on user type?

4.Does the above depend on gender of the user?
  
Key Insights:
The variables 'bike_count' and 'duration_sec' are inversely proportional to each other.

In all the three kind of plots(hourly,weekly and monthly):

1.the number of bikes used by men is more but average duration time spent by them is less.

2.the number of bikes used by others is less but average duration time spent by them is more.

3.the number of bikes used on weekends is less but average duration time spent by them is more.

Findings:
In this analysis by plotting #Bike type behaviour throughout that day,weekend and month,I conclude the following:
The average age of the users is around 37.
Customers use bikes mainly between 8 am - 7 pm.
Subscribers on the other side use the system at around 8-9am and 5-6pm.
Customers use bikes most during weekends.
Subscribers use the bikes mostly during the weekdays.
There are more male users in both customer and subscriber types.
